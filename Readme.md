A very simple interface to convert non-linked Genshin Impact codes into links.

Installation:
Go here: https://ailag.github.io/Genshin-codes-linker/
Or just put it on a web server. It's just HTML. But if you open it without a server your browser won't like it.

Usage:
Either paste a URL or text into it, e.g. the contents of a forum post you just saw.
Not both!
If I'm not too lazy I'll make them mutually exclusive graphically too.

Then submit.

Bonus: The links you haven't visited - on this machine, on this browser, since the last time you cleared your history - will be highlighted.
This is saved in the browser, not in this gadget.
